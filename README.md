# Available scripts

### `yarn && yarn start`

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `yarn eject`

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
